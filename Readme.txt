Predictive Model for High School Students' Academic Performance

This project aims to predict high school students' academic performance based on socio-economic factors and other attributes. By understanding these factors, schools can implement targeted interventions to improve student outcomes and overall school performance.

Narrative of Key Steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Data Sources: Gathered data from various schools, including socio-economic indicators and academic records.
Cleaning and Aggregation: Used Pandas and NumPy to clean and aggregate the data, handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.
Insights: Identified key factors like family income, parental education, and attendance rates influencing academic performance.
Model Building:

Models Used: Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting models using Scikit-learn.
Training and Validation: Split the data into training and testing sets, applying cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, and AUC.
Best Model: The Gradient Boosting model performed best, providing a reliable prediction of students' academic success.
Results and Deployment:

Key Findings: Highlighted that family income and parental education are strong predictors of student performance.
Business Value: Schools can use these insights to allocate resources more effectively and design programs that support at-risk students.
